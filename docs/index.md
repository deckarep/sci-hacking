### ScummVM SCI Debugger

The following debugger commands are *specific* to the debugger console built into the `ScummVM` engine.

**Tip**: Starting `ScummVM` from a `terminal` session allows you to view some important output that is logged to `STDOUT` when executing some debug commands. For serious debugging, *you'll want to do this* to get a richer experience when debugging.

**Note**: This list of commands is certainly not exhaustive and some commands only work on certain version of the SCI engine. Typing `help` will show all the available commands but if you get stuck [check the source code](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/engines/sci/console.cpp) for a further understanding of how the debug commands work.

#### Starting ScummVM for debugging
```sh
# Navigate to the directory of where ScummVM app is installed:
cd ScummVM.app/Contents/MacOS

# Type this to run it from the terminal:
./scummvm
```

#### Open debugger console
MacOS: `[OPTION] + [CTRL] + [SHIFT] + D`

#### Common commands to know
```sh
# Dismiss debugger console (press ESC) or:
) exit
) go

# Get help by typing this into the console:
) help

# Get help on how memory addressing works in the debugger:
) addresses

# Get version of game:
) version

# Restart the game:
) restart_game

# Quit the game:
) quit

# Change rooms:
) room <room-num>
) room 440

# Execute a selector to read the memory:
) send <obj> <selector>
) send theBadge x

# Execute a selector to update memory:
) send <obj> <selector> [arg1, arg2, ...]
) send theBadge x 150

# Inspect scripts currently loaded into memory:
) scro *

# View an object properties and methods:
) vo <obj>
) vo theBadge

```

#### Probing memory

SCI games use a 2 component 16bit addressing system that comprises of two parts depending on what they hold.

* When used as a pointer both components are used like so:
  * `[0032]:[2cf4]`
  * The first component is the segment id and the second component is some absolute or relative offset into memory.
* When used as just pure data such as a y coordinate they look like so:
  * `[0000]:[0005]`
  * The first component is just all zeroes since it's not really a pointer and the second component is some value.

```sh
# Inspect the registers
) registers

# Inspect the stack
) stack <depth>
) stack 10

# List variables (global, local, temp, param)
) vmvarlist or vl

# Display or change vars (global, local, temp, param)
) vv <type> <varnum> [<value>]
) vv g 0
```

#### Stepping through code
```sh
# View current breakpoints
) bl

# Set a break point
) bpx <obj>::<method-selector>
) bpx theBadge::init

# Once triggered step through the code using:
) s

# Delete breakpoint
) bp_del <name>
) bp_del * # deletes all

# Show the method stack-trace (also called backtrace): 
) bt
```

#### Disassembling methods
```sh
# Dump disassembly instructions on an object method to the terminal via STDOUT:
) disasm <obj> <method-selector> bcc
) disasm gammie doit bcc
```

### Bytecode VM hacks

The VM doesn't have the concept of a NOP instruction (which is an instruction that simply does nothing). Therefore these two methods are recommended to accomplish a similar thing for a patch.

```sh
# Use jump instruction to skip over instructions effectively making them no-ops.
jmp <relpos>

# Another method is to empty the accumulator to cause instructions to operate against nothing or a NULL pointer.
ldi 0000
```

### Example Hacks

#### Leisure Suit Larry 6 Hack - Cav Easter Egg Exposed

How this patch works: Since the logic for the game is located in file `440.SCR` and this resource is *not compressed*, the bytecode instruction set is available for hex-editing.

In total *3 bytes* must be changed. Since two selectors are enqueued to be executed for the asset in question, we effectively need to prevent the `hide` one from running. We accomplish this by changing the instructions to use a `jmp 1` instead of `pushi 66` where `0x66` is the selector for `hide` replacing the two bytes responsible for enqueueing `hide` on the stack as the second selector to be executed. (The other is `init` which must still run.)

We're not quite done...in the original code since the `stack` is setup to handle 2 selector calls this means that `send 0x08` should be `send 0x04` instead because the stack is effectively halved since the `hide` selector was not pushed and we need to make sure that the `send` command accounts for only *4 bytes* on the stack vs 8 bytes.

```sh
# lsl6 dos (non-hires) - (room 440)
# ) disasm closeUpInset init bcc

# Patch is applied to file: 440.SCR

# Before
0036:1a5e: 0x39, 0x6e,                          // pushi        6e              ; 110, 'n', init
0036:1a60: 0x76,                                // push0
0036:1a61: 0x39, 0x66,                          // pushi        66              ; 102, 'f', hide
0036:1a63: 0x76,                                // push0
0036:1a64: 0x72, 0xba, 0x04,                    // lofsa        tits[2c05]
0036:1a67: 0x4a, 0x08,                          // send         08

# After
0036:1a5e: 0x39, 0x6e,                          // pushi        6e              ; 110, 'n', init
0036:1a60: 0x76,                                // push0
0036:1a61: 0x33, 0x01,                          // jmp          01              ; jump +1
0036:1a63: 0x76,                                // push0                        ; <SKIPPED FROM JUMP>
0036:1a64: 0x72, 0xba, 0x04,                    // lofsa        tits[2c05]
0036:1a67: 0x4a, 0x04,                          // send         04              ; 4 instead of 8 since we're invoking one selector: (init) instead of two selectors: (init & hide).
```
